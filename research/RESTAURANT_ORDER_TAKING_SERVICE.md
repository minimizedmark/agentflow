*[They'll say: "A lot" or "Too many"]*

*"Industry average is 43% - almost HALF your calls go unanswered. At $48 per order, that's probably costing you $30,000-300,000 a year."*

*"We built an AI that answers every call, takes orders perfectly, and sends them straight to your kitchen. No hold times, no errors, no missed orders."*

*"Best part? You only pay $1.50 per order we take. If we don't take an order, you don't pay. No monthly fee, no contract. Just orders you would've lost."*
