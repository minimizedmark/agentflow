## 🎯 The Market Opportunity

### Small Businesses WITHOUT Websites

**The shocking stats:**
- **27% of small businesses still have NO website** (2024 data)
- That's **9 million businesses** in the US alone
- Top reasons:
  1. "Too expensive" (46%)
  2. "Don't know how" (34%)
  3. "Don't have time" (28%)
  4. "Not tech-savvy" (22%)

**Why they need websites:**
- **81% of consumers** research online before buying
- **88% of consumers** won't return after bad UX
- **Google My Business** is not enough (no booking, no ordering)

- Built 5-10 years ago, never updated
