# Growth & Retention Services - Complete the Customer Success Loop

## Overview: The Missing Pieces

We've built communication (calls, SMS, email), digital presence (websites), and operations (invoicing, ordering). But we're missing the **customer acquisition & retention loop**:

1. **Get more customers** (reviews, lead nurturing)
2. **Keep them coming back** (broadcast marketing)
3. **Get paid faster** (text-to-pay)

These 4 services complete the platform.
