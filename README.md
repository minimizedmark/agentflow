# AgentFlow - Complete Business Operations Platform

## Build Your Stack. Pay for What You Use. Nothing More.

**We don't believe in gouging small businesses with forced bundles and features you'll never use.**

AgentFlow is a modular AI platform built FOR small businesses, BY people who understand your needs. Pick the services that help YOUR business. Leave the rest. Add more when you're ready.

**No contracts. No monthly minimums (except $5 hosting). No features you don't need.**

Just honest, transparent automation that saves you money and helps you grow.

**Operations** → Automate invoicing, payments, scheduling
**Digital Presence** → Website, booking widgets, online ordering
**Growth** → Get reviews, nurture leads, market to customers
**Intelligence** → Call recording, analytics, sentiment analysis

**One platform. Everything works together. Pay only for what you use.**

## How It Works (Ridiculously Simple)

**1. Pick** - Click a service. Read what it does in plain English.
**2. Enable** - Flip the switch. It works immediately.
**3. Done** - See your usage and costs in real-time.

**No complicated setup. No technical jargon. No 45-minute onboarding calls.**

- Multi-agent workflows (classify → route → respond → act)
- Free/low-cost LLMs where possible (Groq, OpenAI GPT-4o-mini)
- OpenAI for critical paths (99.9% uptime)
- Fallback strategies for reliability

### 🔧 **Modular & Extensible**

- All services share common infrastructure
- Database-driven service registry
- Automatic billing integration
